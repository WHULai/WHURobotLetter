#letter-content[
  I am writing to share the Typst letter template included in this repository, which is adapted from the Modern CV package originally developed by DeveloperPaul123. Whereas the original project presents a cover-letter workflow for job applications, this version reshapes that component into a more general-purpose letter format intended for academic and professional correspondence.

#letter-content[
  The revised template preserves the clean typography and balanced header layout of the original design, while making several deliberate changes. In particular, it replaces the `coverletter` and `hiring-entity-info` interface with the more neutral `letter` and `recipient-info` structure, substitutes the job-position heading with an optional subject line, introduces a `letter-content` helper with indented paragraphs, and updates the footer and language metadata from "Cover Letter" to "Letter" for broader multilingual use.
]

#letter-content[
  It also removes the assumption that every letter must accompany a curriculum vitae, so attachments can now be declared only when needed, and it reworks the closing section around a straightforward local signature block better suited to routine standalone letters. In this way, the adaptation keeps the visual discipline of Modern CV while contributing a clearer and lighter interface for everyday formal communication.

#letter-content[
  I am grateful to DeveloperPaul123 for the original Modern CV work, which provided the Typst design foundation for this adaptation. I hope this revised template will prove useful to students and faculty members seeking a formal Typst-based alternative for regular correspondence.
